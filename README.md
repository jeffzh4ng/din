# din
a CPU compiler (C89 -> RISC-V); [a project of one's own](https://paulgraham.com/own.html)

### Architecture
Refer to [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for a more comprehensive overview.
TL;DR:
- frontend: handwritten lexer and parser (pratt)
- backend: TODO

### Roadmap
1. Interpreting
2. Compiling to LLVM
3. Compiling to RISC-V
