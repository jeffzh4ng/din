## Von Neumann Architecture
Intuition from multi machine architecture (k8s/temporal/linkerd/tailscale):
-> whenever your problem looks like orchestration workers:
- you're going to have a control plane and a data plane.

- control plane aka brawn: fetch/decode
- data plane aka brain: ALU
- state: memory

For machines specifically: von Neuman architecture (load/store)
1. control:
  - interpretatin of stored value (instruction or data)depends on control signals
    (IP/OP) from control unit
  --> what part you are in the FSM depends on the control signals
                                            |--------|
control plane:   |fetch/decode| ------------|        |
                                            | memory |
data plane:      |ALU| ---------------------|        |
                registers                   |--------|
